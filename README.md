# TL-DA-TF
Transfer Learning in Deep Architectures using TFLearn -> (Google)TensorFlow 

##Basic
The main task is start a model training, then save this model for a further restoration, where the training process can be resumed.
- [MLP](https://github.com/migueldsw/TL-DA-TF/blob/master/MLP.py): It creates a simple MLP and runs few epochs of training on MNIST database, then saves the model.
- [MLP-Loaded](https://github.com/migueldsw/TL-DA-TF/blob/master/MLP-Loaded.py): It loads the previously initiated MLP and continues the training process through more epochs.

##VGG (Adjusted Model)
- [VGG-11/16](https://github.com/migueldsw/TL-DA-TF/tree/master/VGG): Adjusted VGG model for initial training and restore (_load)
